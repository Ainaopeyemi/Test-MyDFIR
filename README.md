[Brief Introduction - Remove this afterwards]

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective
Setting objectives for cybersecurity is crucial to ensure the protection of information systems and data. Here are some key objectives to consider:

### 1. **Protect Confidentiality**
   - **Objective**: Safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
   - **Actions**: Implement access controls, encryption, and data classification measures.

### 2. **Ensure Integrity**
   - **Objective**: Maintain the accuracy and completeness of data and systems.
   - **Actions**: Use checksums, hashes, and data validation techniques to prevent and detect tampering.

### 3. **Guarantee Availability**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.
   - **Actions**: Implement redundancy, backup solutions, and disaster recovery plans.

### 4. **Manage Risk**
   - **Objective**: Identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
   - **Actions**: Conduct regular risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.

### 5. **Comply with Regulations**
   - **Objective**: Adhere to relevant laws, regulations, and standards.
   - **Actions**: Implement policies and procedures that meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

### 6. **Develop Incident Response Plans**
   - **Objective**: Prepare for and respond effectively to cybersecurity incidents.
   - **Actions**: Create and test incident response plans, establish communication protocols, and conduct training.

### 7. **Promote Security Awareness**
   - **Objective**: Increase the security awareness and knowledge of employees and stakeholders.
   - **Actions**: Conduct regular training sessions, phishing simulations, and awareness campaigns.

### 8. **Implement Secure Development Practices**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that software and systems are developed with security in mind.
   - **Actions**: Follow secure coding practices, conduct code reviews, and use automated security testing tools.

### 9. **Monitor and Respond to Threats**
   - **Objective**: Detect and respond to cybersecurity threats in a timely manner.
   - **Actions**: Use intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) tools, and continuous monitoring.

### 10. **Maintain Business Continuity**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the organization's operations can continue during and after a cybersecurity incident.
   - **Actions**: Develop and maintain a business continuity plan, conduct regular drills, and ensure data backups are up-to-date.

### 11. **Foster a Security Culture**
   - **Objective**: Create an organizational culture that prioritizes cybersecurity.
   - **Actions**: Encourage reporting of security incidents, reward proactive security behavior, and integrate security into all business processes.

### 12. **Evaluate and Improve Security Posture**
   - **Objective**: Continuously assess and enhance the organization's security measures.
   - **Actions**: Perform regular security audits, benchmark against industry standards, and implement improvements based on findings.

Focusing on these objectives can help organizations build a robust cybersecurity framework that protects against threats and ensures the resilience of their information systems.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity and data science , and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
